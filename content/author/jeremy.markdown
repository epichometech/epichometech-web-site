Summary: Career network engineer with expanding interests into DevSecOps and automation with Python

Greetings! My name is Jeremy, and I am a career network engineer with a passion for expanding my technical skillset through exploration and experimentation. With 12 years of experience in network engineering and a lifetime of using Linux, I have developed a strong foundation in networking technologies and an affinity for open-source software.

From an early age, I have been fascinated with technology and its endless possibilities. My first foray into tinkering with technology was with MythTV, which eventually led me to build a Plex-based DVR system. The satisfaction I felt from building something that improved my quality of life while reducing costs ignited a spark in me to continue exploring and evolving my projects.

One of my most exciting projects involved experimenting with emerging technologies, such as GPU passthrough, and building a consolidated mediapc. Although my first attempt was a failure, I persisted and tried again a few years later using Proxmox and some NVIDIA GPUs. Today, I use this setup as my primary desktop for business and gaming.

Throughout my career and personal projects, I have learned that the journey is just as important as the destination. My willingness to explore new technologies has led to greater knowledge and amazing experiences. My passion for home automation and IoT, network automation, and development with Python, Node-Red, and Home Assistant has driven me to continuously expand my skills.

As a writer, I hope to share my experiences and knowledge with my readers through my blog articles. I believe that sharing my passion for learning and exploration can inspire others to dive deeper into their own interests and discover new possibilities.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I hope to continue sharing my journey with you through my writing and exploring new technologies as they emerge.
